Batteries-included development environment for the [Defold game engine](https://defold.com), powered by [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

## Features

- **Code Hot-Reloading**: Make code tweaks and see them live in Defold, no waiting.
- **Defold Control from Neovim**: Run Defold commands right from Neovim with custom shortcuts.
- **LSP Integration**: Get Defold API hints and autocomplete in Neovimâ€™s built-in LSP.

## System Requirements

This plugin is designed for Linux and supports macOS. Windows is untested and probably doesn't work (yet)

This plugin is using [Babashka](https://babashka.org) internally to circumvent Neovim Luas API limitations.
If you do not have Babashka installed on your system, the plugin will download and manage its own local copy
which will however add a few more requirements.

If you have Babashka installed you'll only need either lsof, ss or netstat

If not, we'll also need curl and tar in addition

## Install

### Lazy.nvim

```lua
{
    "atomicptr/defold.nvim",
    lazy = false,

    -- (Optional) Required when using the debugger
    dependencies = {
        "mfussenegger/nvim-dap",
    },

    opts = {
        defold = {
            -- Automatically set defold.nvim as the default editor in Defold (default: true)
            set_default_editor = true,

            -- Automatically fetch dependencies on launch (default: true)
            auto_fetch_dependencies = true,

            -- Enable hot reloading when saving scripts in Neovim (default: true)
            hot_reload_enabled = true,
        },

        debugger = {
            -- Enable the debugger (default: true)
            enable = true,

            -- Use a custom executable for the debugger (default: nil)
            custom_executable = nil,
        },

        babashka = {
            -- Use a custom executable for babashka (default: nil)
            custom_executable = nil,
        },

        -- Force the plugin to be always enabled (even if we can't find the game.project file) (default: false)
        force_plugin_enabled = false,
    },
}
```

## Setup Neovim

By installing and running the plugin once, Defold should automatically use Neovim as its editor. (Unless you disabled the setting above)

If you manually want to setup Defold, run `:SetupDefold`

## Setup Debugging

For debugging we're using [mobdap](https://github.com/atomicptr/mobdap) which is running on top of [MobDebug](https://github.com/pkulchenko/MobDebug) so you need to have that available
in your project.

The easiest way is using [defold-mobdebug](https://github.com/atomicptr/defold-mobdebug) in your project.

[(Read this)](https://github.com/atomicptr/defold-mobdebug?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

And then you run use ``:DapNew`` and the game should be running

## Available Commands

Here's how you can interact with Defold directly from Neovim:

* **:Defold**
    This commands starts vim.ui.select to let you select a Defold command to run

* **:DefoldSend `<command>`**
    This command lets you send any arbitrary command directly to your Defold editor. Use this for scripting or keybindings. For example, use **`:DefoldSend build`** to trigger build & run.

* **:DefoldFetch**
    This command fetches all Defold dependencies and creates annotations for the Lua LSP. Run with bang to force re-downloading the annotations.

* **:SetupDefold**
    This commands does the required setup for Defold to use Neovim as its external editor (this will be done by default unless disabled, see config above)
